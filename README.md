# Graph Algorithms Visualizer

This graph algorithms visualizer aims to clarify understanding of common graph search algorithms. 

Fully supported algorithms include the following:
- Breadth-first search

Algorithms that will be added in the future include the following:
- Depth-first search
- Dijkstra's
- Bellman-Ford
- Johnson's

## Tools used:
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- Canvas API
- Browserify
- Tsify

To run browserify on the original TypeScript files, use the following command:
```npx browserify SCRIPT_NAME.ts -p tsify > bundle.js```
